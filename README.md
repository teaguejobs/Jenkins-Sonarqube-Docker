Jenkins is a popular open-source automation server that helps automate various tasks in the software development process, including building, testing, and deploying software. Github is a code repository that provides version control and collaboration tools, and Sonarqube is a code quality management tool that helps analyze and manage code quality in software projects. Docker is a containerization platform that helps simplify the deployment of software applications.

First, we will create an AWS EC2 instance and install Jenkins on it. We will then set up a Github repository and integrate it with Jenkins. Next, we will configure Sonarqube to analyze code quality in our Github repository. Finally, we will create a Docker image of our application and deploy it using Jenkins.
